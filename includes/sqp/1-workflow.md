    **Depending what's released first and available the following Workflow Logic will be used:**

    - When a 1080p WEBDL is released it will download the 1080p WEB-DL. (streaming services)
    - When a BHDStudio is released it will download the BHDStudio releases.
    - If no BHDStudio can be found (not existing or limited sources) it will download a 1080p Bluray Encodes (less or not streaming optimized).
