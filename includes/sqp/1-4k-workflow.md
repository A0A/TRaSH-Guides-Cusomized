## Workflow Logic

??? abstract "Workflow Logic - [Click to show/hide]"

    **Depending what's released first and available the following Workflow Logic will be used:**

    - When a 1080p WEBDL is released it will download the 1080p WEB-DL. (streaming services)
    - When a BHDStudio is released it will download the BHDStudio releases.
    - If no BHDStudio can be found (not existing or limited sources) it will download a 1080p Bluray Encodes (less or not streaming optimized).
    - When a 2160p WEBDL is released it will download the 2160p WEB-DL. (streaming services)
    - When a 2160p BHDStudio is released it will download the 2160p BHDStudio releases.
    - Where the 2160p will upgrade the 1080p.

    !!! info "2160p BHDStudio will trump any 2160p WEBDL regardless if it has DV HDR10 or only HDR10"

    ------

    *Possible Variables*

    - Prefer 1080p/2160p WEBDL with IMAX-E.
    - Leave out 1080p if you use SQP-1 (1080p) as your main/other Radarr
